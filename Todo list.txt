General: 
1. Find new background images
2. Add obstacles/Terrain
3. Find new cannon images/ sprites?
4. Add a score text to the game
5. Add Terrain class 
6. Checkout game logic for terrains in different games 



Cannons: 
1. Find new images
2. Find animation images/ Allow to skew image/part of image
3. Add hit box 
4. Add game logic for cannonball hit inside the cannons hit box


Cannon balls:
1. Add collision logic with cannon hit boxes
2. Add collision logic for terrain 
3. Add explosion effect 





Cannon Stories:
1. As a user I can mpove the cannon up and down with the 'w' and 's' keys
2. As a user I can see my cannon angle 
3. As a user I can set my cannon ball velocity using the the 'a' and 'd' keys
4. As a user I can see my cannon ball velocity 
5. As a user I can shoot a cannon ball using the space key
6. As a user if I hit the other cannon my score goes up by 1
7. The cannon needs to have a hit box
8. If cannon ball gets to hit box you lose
9. As a user I cannot move the cannon angle to much as it will hit the ground

Cannon ball stories:
1. Cannon ball should look like a black circle
2. Cannon ball should have an hitbox 
3. Cannon ball should follow physics of falling
4. Add a -9.8 velocity to the background to simulate gravity
5. Cannon ball needs x , y coordinates
6. Cannon ball needs a x velocity and y velocity 

Terrain stories:
1. When a cannon ball hits the terrain it should leave a dent


Vision for the future: 
This is my first "serious" game in any programming language. My final vision is to allow player vs player options online. These is still far off. Looking to recreate the cannon classic game from windows 95 and add some more features to it.
